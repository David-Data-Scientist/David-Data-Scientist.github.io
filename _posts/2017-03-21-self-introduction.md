My name is David Huang. I am a graduate student at UC Davis statistics department.

The reason why I love data science dated back to Jan 2015. At that time I was in junior year and participated a Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) where I got quite interested in data analysis. Since then, I read a lot articles about the data science field. In the past, people make decisions based on their instinct, which may lead to some mistakes. But nowadays we can make rational decisions by finding insights through the data. In order to dive into data science field, I exchanged for one year at UC Davis studying statistics. And finally I got admitted and continued learning statistics at UC Davis. Through those years' hands-on practice, I am proficient in doing end-to-end processing: from data acquiring, data cleaning to data modeling and visualization.
