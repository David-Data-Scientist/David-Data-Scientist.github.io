### A Little about Myself

My name is David Huang. I am a graduate student at UC Davis statistics department.

The reason why I love data science dated back to Jan 2015. At that time, I participated Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) and I got interested in data analysis. Since then, I read a lot aricitles about the data science field and also gained hands-on experience through past projects and internships.
