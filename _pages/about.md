### A Little about Myself

My name is David Li. I am a Graduate student at UC Davis Statistics Department and I am expected to graduate in June 2018. 

My bachelor degree is Biomedical Engineering. When I was in junior year, I participated a Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) and I got quite interested in data analysis. In order to dive into data science field, I exchanged for one year at UC Davis studying statistics. And finally I got admitted and continued learning statistics at UC Davis.
