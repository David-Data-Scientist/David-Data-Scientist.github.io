A Little about Myself

My name is David Huang. I am a graduate student at UC Davis statistics department and I am expected to graduate in June 2018.

When I was in junior year, I participated a Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) and I got quite interested in data analysis. In order to dive into data science field, I exchanged for one year at UC Davis studying statistics. And finally I got admitted and continued learning statistics at UC Davis.

Currently I am actively looking for internships related to Data Science.
